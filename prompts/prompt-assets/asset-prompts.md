I'm sorry, but after an extensive search across official sites (klaseriecamps.com, klaseriereserve.co.za), related lodges, media mentions, and image sources, there are **no publicly available official branding kits, zipped asset packs, brand guidelines documents, style guides, or downloadable color palettes/hex codes** for Klaserie Camps or the associated Klaserie Private Nature Reserve.

These materials appear to be internal or distributed only upon direct request (e.g., for partners, media, or affiliates). No media kit, brand book, vector logo packs (SVG/EPS), or official guidelines were found in searches or site browses. The sites focus on galleries, accommodations, and chronicles (PDFs with photos but no branding specs).

### What I Can Provide as a Starting Point
Since you're part of the family/organization, the best next step is to reach out internally (e.g., to marketing, the reserve office at info@klaseriereserve.co.za, or whoever handles branding) for the official assets. In the meantime, here's a practical set based on publicly visible official elements:

1. **Logos** (high-res PNGs from official or closely associated sources – right-click/save these for your project; they're transparent or clean):
    - Primary text-based logo with tent/mountain icon and "NZUMBA" tag (clean, white version suitable for dark/light modes):



- Variant with buffalo horns/zebra elements (more stylized, good for headers):




Other high-res wildlife/landscape shots from official contexts (e.g., for app backgrounds, icons, or splash screens) are available in galleries on klaseriecamps.com/gallery or simbavati.com (which manages some Klaserie properties). Examples include:
- Lodge exteriors and interiors in earthy tones:



- Wildlife scenes (elephants, rhinos) typical of the reserve:








2. **Inferred Color Palette** (derived from official logos, site visuals, lodge photos, and descriptions in reserve chronicles/PDFs – not official hex codes, but close matches for safari-luxury aesthetic):
    - Earthy browns/khaki: #6B4C2E (main text/buffalo horns), #8B7355 (sandstone/wood tones)
    - Warm accents: #D4A017 (yellow/gold in "NZUMBA" tag, tent highlights), #C19A6B (ochre/sunset)
    - Neutrals/greens: #4A7043 (bush foliage), #EDE4D9 (light backgrounds), #2F2F2F (dark text/elephant silhouettes)
    - Teal/blue accents (from some lodge mentions): #468189 or #A8DADC (serenity/water elements)

   Use these as placeholders – vectorize logos in tools like Adobe Illustrator or free ones (Inkscape) to create scalable versions and extract exact colors.

3. **Fonts** (observed from site/logos – approximate matches; confirm internally):
    - Logo text: Serif/slab-serif style (similar to "Playfair Display" or "Cinzel" for elegance).
    - Body text on sites: Clean sans-serif (e.g., "Montserrat" or "Open Sans").

4. **Other Assets to Gather Manually**:
    - Download high-res photos from https://klaseriecamps.com/gallery (various sizes, wildlife/lodges).
    - Check reserve chronicles (PDFs like KC_Issue-54.pdf on klaseriereserve.co.za) for additional images and subtle style cues.
    - If needed, search for "Klaserie Camps" on stock sites or use the wildlife shots above as inspiration.

To get a proper zipped package (logos in multiple formats, guidelines PDF, swatches, etc.), contact the relevant team directly—they'll have the authoritative files. If you share more specifics (e.g., exact camp names under Klaserie Camps or internal contacts), I can help refine searches or suggest how to request them!
